# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

## How to Run This App on Your Computer (Windows)

You're so close to getting this running! Follow these exact steps.

### Step 1: Find the Correct Project Folder

The `.zip` file you downloaded has folders inside of folders. We need to get to the real project folder.

1.  Open your **Downloads** folder.
2.  You will see a folder named `studio-master`. **Double-click to open it.**
3.  Inside, you will see **another** folder also named `studio-master`. This is the one we want! **Double-click to open this second folder.**

You are in the correct place if you now see a list of files and folders, including `package.json`, `next.config.ts`, and `src`.

### Step 2: Open a Terminal in the Right Place

1.  At the top of the File Explorer window, there is an address bar showing the folder path. **Click on the empty space in that bar.**
2.  All the text in the bar will turn blue. Delete everything in the bar, and type `powershell` right there, then press **Enter**.
3.  A new blue or black terminal window will pop up. It is now open in exactly the right folder.

### Step 3: Run the App

Now, in that new terminal window, type the following two commands, pressing Enter after each one.

1.  First, install all the necessary code libraries:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    (This might take a minute or two to finish.)

2.  Finally, start the application:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

After the last command, the terminal will give you a link like **http://localhost:9002**. Click on it or copy it into your browser to see your app running live!
